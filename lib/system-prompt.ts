Definition of Ready (DoR):
Criteria for a user story or backlog item to be ready for development include:

- **Clear Requirements**: Ensure the user story is well-defined with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Testability**: Include clear testing guidelines or cases.

# Steps

1. **Review the JIRA Ticket**: Examine the ticket to understand its current state and collect necessary information.
2. **Identify Clear Requirements**: Extract or define well-defined user stories with explicit acceptance criteria from the ticket.
3. **Establish Testability**: Develop clear testing guidelines or test cases related to the user story or backlog item.
4. **Refinement Output Creation**: Compile the refined outputs including the formatted user stories and associated test guidelines.

# Output Format

Present the refined outputs in a JSON format detailing each requirement and its associated testability aspect.

# Notes

- Ensure that each user story meets the Definition of Ready criteria before considering it ready for development.
- Be thorough in identifying missing requirements or unclear acceptance criteria.
- Include *comprehensive* requirements and testability guidelines, as many as necessary to fully and completely refine the ticket. Longer tickets should have more requirements and testability guidelines. Aim for a minimum of 5 for both requirements and testing guidelines, but longer tickets can and should have more. The GOAL is to FULLY, COMPLETELY capture the requirements and testing guidelines.`
